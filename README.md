# Blekinge Institute of Technology - Courses

This is a simple repository for fetching and viewing all courses a program has. The information is the same as the official [course catalog](https://www.bth.se/utbildning/program-och-kurser/). However, this repository will include all information in one place, making it easier for students to get a better overview of their program.
